There is always more to do. This file is a simple list for myself to remember where I left off and what still needs done.
 - Improve classify-test to NOT have to take the levenshtein distance of all the instances again
 - compare non-threaded to threaded minZ values
 - export environment variables so that both the python and c++ run scripts can source them for common variables
